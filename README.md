# Air conditioning (heat pump) simulator
Trying to build and connect all the components of an air conditioner (basically heat pump) and simulate cooling and heating spaces. 

Goal of the project is mainly to learn Rust and I thought it would be fun. Of course not implementing real world thermodynamics.
